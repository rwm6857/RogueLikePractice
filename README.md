# RogueLikePractice
This is my first game ever made!
I decided to go with the roguelike genre as it's not too easy, but not too challenging.

In this project, I followed a [tutorial](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html)
by [Trystan](https://github.com/trystan).

I had to implement his [Ascii Panel](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) to help display ascii terminals with code page 437.
